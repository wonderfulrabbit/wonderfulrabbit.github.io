                To cast a spell as a ritual, you start with a regular spell you know. Then you tell
                the table what you are trying to accomplish and gather necessary ingredients for the
                ritual. Then go through a mini-montage where every adventurer narrates their
                contribution. Then make a check. No matter the outcome, the spell is expended until 
                your next full proper rest. On a success, the ritual works as intended. Choose
                outcomes that are outgrowths of the spell's normal effects. The effects don’t have
                to play within the usual constraints of the magic system, and they don't have to be
                taken as a precedent for future rituals. Failure should fail forward as usual.
